    <h2>TABLESIDE COCKTAILS & SUPPER</h2>
    <p>The Rotunda, an iconic room within The Pierre, was
    re-imagined in 2016 by renowned architect and designer Daniel Romualdez. Having served as an event space in the hotel for the past decade, The Rotunda returns to the ranks of The Pierre’s storied public spaces with tableside cocktails and all-day dining.</p>

        <h4>THE ROTUNDA</h4>
        <p>The Rotunda menus pull inspiration from The Pierre's black tie crowd, with afternoon and supper menus offering dishes from Maine Lobster Tartine to Welsh Rarebit to Spaghetti Bolognese. The room's center table is covered by chilled champagne, overflowing jars of madeleines and macarons, and tiers of chocolate cakes and seasonal bundts.</p>
        <p>The room's cocktail carts bring bespoke drinks tableside, with one cart offering a selection of classic cocktails inspired by famous mixologists from The Pierre and elsewhere. A specialty cart serves rare spirits  that change with the seasons.</p>
